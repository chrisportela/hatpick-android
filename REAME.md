#Hat Pick
##for android
Hat pick is for when you have to make choices among several things. 
It is used primarily in chosing sides, teams, etc in board games &
for figuring out which resturant to go eat at that moment. It's very
simple and may seem lacking, but it simply allows you to do anything
you want.

*Just kidding*, I'm very lazy about this application and never intended
for it to be published on the store and hence why it's not very advanced
at all.

Enjoy it. You'll need to compile it for Android yourself. Everything should
work well. 

NOTE: Made for Android 2.2
